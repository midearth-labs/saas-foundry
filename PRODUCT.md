# SAASFoundry Project Description

## Overview
SAASFoundry is an open-source framework designed to handle the undifferentiated heavy lifting in building SAAS applications. It provides a configurable, pluggable, and extensible set of SAAS/AI modules and UI components that enable technical founders to focus on their core product differentiators rather than common SAAS infrastructure.

## Vision & Goals
- Provide a complete, production-ready foundation for SAAS applications
- Enable rapid development without sacrificing flexibility or scalability
- Foster a community-driven ecosystem of plugins and extensions
- Integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into SAAS applications
- Support both technical and non-technical users through various interfaces

## Target Audience
1. Primary: Technical founders building new SAAS products
2. Secondary: 
   - Existing SAAS products seeking modernization
   - Development agencies building SAAS products
   - Enterprise internal tools teams
