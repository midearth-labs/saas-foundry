I'd like to create the actual project for saas-foundry using Node and typescript. I would love to build as a git based  monorepo to contain example sub-packages, pls note this is just a suggestion, advice or ask clarifications based on your understanding of the project.
1. api-model (An API model definition e.g. as OpenAPI or Smithy)
2. api-server (A server implementation based on expressJS)
3. jobs (A backend implementation of 
4. shared-backend (Shared backend utilities)
5. shared-frontend (Shared front end utilities)
6. kits (UI kits)
7. user-frontend (user facing UI features)
8. admin-frontend (admin facing UI features)
9. cli (some quality of life commands for bootstrapping or configuring SAAS dependencies)
10. saasfoundry-website-frontend (A website to showcase the saasfoundry framework, this website dogfoods saasfoundry)
11. saasfoundry-api-server (A website to showcase the saasfoundry framework, this website dogfoods saasfoundry)

Suggest tools to use to manage the repo with focus on performance, I did some research and heard of turborepo. Also note, this project will be built with heavy reliance on Cursor+Claude AI assistance.
